## **Steps to Set Up and Run the Application**  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Node.js (v14+ recommended)**  
- **MongoDB (local or hosted)**  
- **Python 3+**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.dev/nani2916/code_genie
cd code_genie
```

### **2. Front-end Setup**  
Open a terminal and enter the following commands:


```sh
cd code-genie-frontend
npm install
```

### **2. Back-end Setup**  
Create a config.js file in the code-genie-backend root directory and add the following variables:
